ids_4802/validate-metadata

kos.dcm is IDS-DEPT001-a/kos/metadata.xml with:

  <xdsb:ProvideAndRegisterDocumentSetRequest> element added
  
  this was needed because some vendors may specify namespaces at that level.
  
  These other changes were needed because the client metadata for 4801 matched the
  XPaths in DetailXmlKOSMetadataContent, but the provided metadata.xml did not.
  
  <LeafRegistryObjectList> element changed to <RegistryObjectList>
  <rs:SubmitObjectsRequest> element changed to <lcm:SubmitObjestRequest> (see also lcm namespace)
  
  changed:
  
  xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:rim:xds:3.0"
  
  to:
  
  xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:xsd:rim:3.0"
