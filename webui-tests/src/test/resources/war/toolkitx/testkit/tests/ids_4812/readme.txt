SOAP Exceptions

<h2>Retrieve Image Document Set, Exception Cases</h2>

<p/>Tests the ability of the Image Document Source actor (SUT) to respond 
correctly to a Retrieve Image Document Set (RAD-69) Request from an Image 
Document Consumer actor (Simulator) which contains errors.


<p>The first retrieve request (Case 0) is actually a legal request intended to ensure
   that communication with the Imaging Document Source under test is working.
   All other retrieve requests contain configuration or data errors or have
   missing data.
