Detail Cases

<h2>Retrieve Image Document Set, Detail Cases</h2>

<p/>Tests the ability of the Image Document Source actor (SUT) to respond 
correctly to Retrieve Image Document Set (RAD-69) Requests from an Image 
Document Consumer actor (Simulator) representing selected detail cases

<p/>The Imaging Document Source has submitted a KOS for a study with a single 
image in test 4801. If you have not completed the action of submitting the KOS 
object for the test images and making those images available for retrieve, you 
need to complete that step now.

<p/>In these tests, we use the RAD-69 transaction to retrieve the single image 
referenced in the KOS. This test uses the following patient identifier:
<blockquote>IDS-AD001-a^^^&amp;1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.2005.13.20.1000&ISO</blockquote>

<ul>
 <li>Successfully complete IDS Test 4801.</li>
 <li>Make sure the image data referenced in IDS Test 4801 is ready for retrieve 
 using the RAD-69 transaction.</li>
 <li>Execute this test to perform detail case retrieves and validations.
</ul>
